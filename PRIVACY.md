# Privacy Policy for SortAI Pro

SortAI Pro is committed to protecting user privacy. This document outlines how we handle data.

## 1. Data Collection
SortAI Pro does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data to a central server. All application data is stored locally on the user's computer.

## 2. AI Processing
To categorize files, the application sends the **filename** and **extension** (e.g., `invoice_2024.pdf`) to your selected AI provider (Google Gemini, OpenAI, etc.). 
- **Important**: The application **does not** read the content inside your files.
- **Encryption**: All communication with AI providers is conducted over secure HTTPS connections.

## 3. Local Storage
The application stores the following data locally in the application folder:
- `config.json`: Your API keys, folder paths, and settings.
- `history.json`: A log of recently moved files.

## 4. Third-Party Services
The application uses third-party AI APIs (like Google Gemini). Users are subject to the privacy policies of the provider they choose to use.

## 5. Security
API keys entered into the application are masked in the UI. Users are responsible for the security of their local machine where the configuration file is stored.
